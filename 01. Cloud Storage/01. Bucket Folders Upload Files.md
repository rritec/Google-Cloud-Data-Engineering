# Bucket, Folder, Upload Files 

## Overview

1. Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time.
2. We can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

## What you'll do

1. In this hands-on lab you will learn how to use the Cloud console to:

    1. Create a storage bucket
    2. Upload objects to the bucket
    3. Create folders and subfolders in the bucket
    4. Make objects in a storage bucket publicly accessible

# Task 1. Create a bucket

1. Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data in Cloud Storage.
2. To create a bucket:
3. In the Cloud console, go to Navigation menu > Cloud Storage > Buckets.
4. Click + Create:
5. Cloud Console Storage Browser. Create Bucket button is highlighted.
6. Enter your bucket information and click Continue to complete each step:
7. Name your bucket: Enter a unique name for your bucket. For this lab, you can use your Project ID as the bucket name because it will always be unique.
8. Bucket naming rules:
9. Do not include sensitive information in the bucket name, because the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible.
10. Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (-), underscores (_), and dots (.). Names containing dots require verification.
11. Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
12. Bucket names must contain 3 to 63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.
13. Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
14. Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix. Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings of "google".*
15. Also, for DNS compliance and future compatibility, you should not use underscores (_) or have a period adjacent to another period or dash. For example, ".." or "-." or ".-" are not valid in DNS names.
16. Choose Region for Location type and <filled in at lab start> for Location.
17. Choose Standard for default storage class.
18. Choose Uniform for Access control and uncheck Enforce public access prevention on this bucket to turn it off.
19. Leave the rest of the fields as their default values and click Create.
20. That's it â€” you've just created a Cloud Storage bucket!

Note: If you are prompted with Public access will be prevented, uncheck Enforce public access prevention on this bucket and click Confirm.

## Task 2. Upload an object into the bucket

1. Download the file [emp.csv](https://github.com/rritec/Azure-Cloud-Data-Engineering/blob/main/Lab%20Data/emp.csv)
2. In the Cloud Storage browser page, click the name of the bucket that you created.
3. In the Objects tab, click Upload files.
4. In the file dialog, go to the file that you downloaded and select it.
5. After the upload completes, you should see the file name and information about the file, such as its size and type.

## Task 3. Share a bucket publicly

1. To allow public access to the bucket and create a publicly accessible URL for the File
2. Click the Permissions tab above the list of files.
3. Ensure the view is set to Principals. Click Grant Access to view the Add principals pane.
4. In the New principals box, enter **allUsers**.
5. In the Select a role drop-down, select Cloud Storage > Storage Object Viewer.
6. Click Save.
7. In the Are you sure you want to make this resource public? window, click Allow public access.

## Task 4. Create folders

1. In the Objects tab, click **Create folder**.
2. Enter **folder1** for Name and click **Create**.
3. You should see the folder in the bucket with an image of a folder icon to distinguish it from objects.
4. Create a subfolder and upload a file to it:
5. Click **folder1**.
6. Click Create folder.
7. Enter **folder2** for Name and click Create.
8. Click folder2.
9. Click **Upload files**.
10. Select above downloaded file
11. After the upload completes, you should see the file name and information about the file, such as its size and type.

## Task 5. Delete a folder

1. Click the arrow next to Bucket details to return to the buckets level.
2. Select the bucket.
3. Click on the Delete button.
4. In the window that opens, type DELETE to confirm the deletion of the folder.
5. Click Delete to permanently delete the folder and all objects and subfolders in it.
