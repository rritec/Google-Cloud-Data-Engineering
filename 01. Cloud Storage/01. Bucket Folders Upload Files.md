# Bucket, Folder, Upload Files 

## Overview

1. Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time. You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content, storing data for archival and disaster recovery, or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.

## What you'll do

1. In this hands-on lab you will learn how to use the Cloud console to:

    1. Create a storage bucket
    2. Upload objects to the bucket
    3. Create folders and subfolders in the bucket
    4. Make objects in a storage bucket publicly accessible

# Task 1. Create a bucket

1. Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data in Cloud Storage.
2. To create a bucket:
3. In the Cloud console, go to Navigation menu > Cloud Storage > Buckets.
4. Click + Create:
5. Cloud Console Storage Browser. Create Bucket button is highlighted.
6. Enter your bucket information and click Continue to complete each step:
7. Name your bucket: Enter a unique name for your bucket. For this lab, you can use your Project ID as the bucket name because it will always be unique.
8. Bucket naming rules:
9. Do not include sensitive information in the bucket name, because the bucket namespace is global and publicly visible.
10. Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (-), underscores (_), and dots (.). Names containing dots require verification.
11. Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
12. Bucket names must contain 3 to 63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.
13. Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
14. Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix. Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings of "google".*
15. Also, for DNS compliance and future compatibility, you should not use underscores (_) or have a period adjacent to another period or dash. For example, ".." or "-." or ".-" are not valid in DNS names.

Choose Region for Location type and <filled in at lab start> for Location.

Choose Standard for default storage class.

Choose Uniform for Access control and uncheck Enforce public access prevention on this bucket to turn it off.

Leave the rest of the fields as their default values and click Create.

That's it â€” you've just created a Cloud Storage bucket!

Note: If you are prompted with Public access will be prevented, uncheck Enforce public access prevention on this bucket and click Confirm.

## Task 3. Share a bucket publicly

To allow public access to the bucket and create a publicly accessible URL for the image:

Click the Permissions tab above the list of files.

Ensure the view is set to Principals. Click Grant Access to view the Add principals pane.

In the New principals box, enter allUsers.

In the Select a role drop-down, select Cloud Storage > Storage Object Viewer.

Click Save.

In the Are you sure you want to make this resource public? window, click Allow public access.

Click Check my progress to verify your performed task. If you have successfully shared an object publicly from your bucket, you will see an assessment score.

Share a kitten.png object publicly
To verify, click the Objects tab to return to the list of objects. Your object's Public access column should read Public to internet.
Note: If your object does not appear to be public after following the previous steps, you may need to refresh your browser page.
Press the Copy URL button for your object and paste it into a separate tab to view your image.
The Copy URL button provides a shareable URL similar to the following:

https://storage.googleapis.com/YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/kitten.png

## Task 4. Create folders

In the Objects tab, click Create folder.

Enter folder1 for Name and click Create.

You should see the folder in the bucket with an image of a folder icon to distinguish it from objects.

Click folder1.

Click Create folder.

Enter folder2 for Name and click Create.

Click folder2.

Click Upload files.

In the file dialog, navigate to the screenshot that you downloaded and select it.

After the upload completes, you should see the file name and information about the file, such as its size and type.

## Task 5. Delete a folder

Click the arrow next to Bucket details to return to the buckets level.

Select the bucket.

Click on the Delete button.

In the window that opens, type DELETE to confirm the deletion of the folder.

Click Delete to permanently delete the folder and all objects and subfolders in it.
